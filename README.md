Banking System Project - Java OOP Concepts
Project Overview
This Banking System project is a practical demonstration of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, including Abstraction, Inheritance, Interfaces, and Polymorphism. It simulates various transaction types (UPI, Bank Transfer, PayPal) and provides a flexible, scalable framework to handle different financial transactions.

Key Goal: The project is designed to showcase the power of OOP principles in building a real-world system that can easily be extended and modified, aligning with industry standards for creating robust financial software.

Key Technologies & Concepts Used
Java Programming Language: Core Java concepts (OOP, collections, etc.).
Object-Oriented Design:
Abstraction: Abstract classes and interfaces to simplify the handling of different transaction types.
Polymorphism: Flexible handling of transactions of different types using a common method.
Inheritance: Code reusability through a common Transaction class.
Interfaces: Ensuring that different transaction types adhere to a common contract (executeTransaction()).
Real-World Problem Solved
This project solves the problem of handling multiple transaction types in a consistent and scalable manner. In the fintech industry, different transaction methods (UPI, bank transfer, PayPal, etc.) are used, and each needs to be processed in a reliable, efficient way.

Industry Relevance:

Financial Services: This project demonstrates the implementation of multiple transaction methods that banks, payment processors, and fintech companies use to handle payments securely and efficiently.
Scalability: The system is easily extensible to accommodate future transaction types (e.g., credit card, Google Pay).
Key Features & Benefits
Flexible and Extensible: Add new transaction types by simply extending the Transaction class and implementing the ITransaction interface.
Scalable: Easily scalable to accommodate new features or transaction methods without affecting existing code.
Easy to Understand: The structure clearly demonstrates how abstraction and inheritance help keep the code clean and manageable.
Real-World Application: The use of real-world transaction scenarios (UPI, Bank Transfer, PayPal) demonstrates practical software design in the fintech sector.
How It Works
Transaction Class: The abstract Transaction class contains shared properties (e.g., amount, sender, receiver) and methods common to all transaction types.
ITransaction Interface: Defines the method executeTransaction(), which all transaction types must implement.
Transaction Subclasses: Concrete classes (UPITransaction, BankTransfer, PayPalTransaction) inherit from the Transaction class and implement the ITransaction interface. Each class simulates a specific transaction type with unique properties.
Main Application: The BankingApp.java class initializes and processes different transaction types by invoking the executeTransaction() method.
Learning Outcomes
Mastered Object-Oriented Design in Java: Gained hands-on experience with key OOP concepts like Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.
Implemented Industry-Standard Design Principles: Used interfaces and abstract classes to create clean, maintainable, and reusable code that adheres to real-world best practices.
Real-World Problem Solving: Built a solution to simulate and handle various transaction types, reflecting actual systems used by fintech companies.
Scalable and Flexible Architecture: The project demonstrates a flexible design that can be easily extended with new features (e.g., adding more transaction types).
